	<p>This is a style test for HTML elements within a text field,
		such as might be produced by a wysiwyg editor. </p>

	<p>P tag - paragraph. </p>

	<p><strong>Strong is used to indicate strong importance</strong></p>

	<p><em>This text has added emphasis</em></p>

	<p><strong><em>Unbelievabaly strong and emphasized text</em></strong></p>

	<p>The <b>b element</b> is stylistically different text from normal text, without any special importance</p>

	<p>The <i>i element</i> is text that is set off from the normal text</p>

	<p>This is a blockquote, which you really should not use outside of a blockquote component:</p>

	<blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708481/characters/nm0000559">
		Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them.
	</blockquote>
	<p> - Spock</p>

	<p>Here are some natural, unstyled elements:</p>

	<p>The <u>u element</u> is text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation</p>

	<p><del>This text is deleted</del> and <ins>This text is inserted</ins></p>

	<p><s>This text has a strikethrough</s></p>

	<p>Superscript<sup>Â®</sup></p>

	<p>Subscript for things like H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

	<p><small>This text is small for fine print, etc.</small></p>

	<p>Abbreviation: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></p>

	<p>Keybord input: <kbd>Cmd</kbd></p>

	<p><q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/q">This text is a short inline quotation</q></p>

	<p><cite>This is a citation</cite></p>

  <p>The <dfn>dfn element</dfn> indicates a definition.</p>

	<p>The <mark>mark element</mark> indicates a highlight</p>

	<p><code>This is what inline code looks like.</code></p>

	<p><samp>This is sample output from a computer program</samp></p>

	<p>The <var>variable element</var>, such as <var>x</var> = <var>y</var></p>
